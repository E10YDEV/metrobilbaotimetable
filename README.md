**MetroBilbaoTimetable** is a simple script that displays the next available train schedules for Metro Bilbao directly in your terminal. Available in both Bash and Python, the script allows you to select an origin and destination, then shows a table with the upcoming trains, their expected arrival times at the origin, and how many minutes remain until they arrive.
